## Structure of a web page
First Project: [basic web pages](./basic-web-pages/basics.html)

The basic structure of a web-page is as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
    <head>
        <!-- Metadata goes here -->
    </head>

    <body>
        <!-- content goes here -->
    </body>
</html>
```

`<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser that the file is an HTML5 web page.

The entire webpage need to be *wrapped* in `<html>` tags. 

    `<html>`: opening tag

    `</html>`: closing tag

Inside the element `<html>` there are **two elements**: `<head>` and `<body>`. The head contains the metadata and the *visible* content is inside the body. 

### Metadata 

Elements of the metadata:

`<title>`: This is display in the tab of the webpage. 

<!-- // to be continued -->

### Paragraphs

`<p>` is the syntaxis for a paragraph, and this tag marks al the text inside as a *distinct paragraph*.

### Headings

There are six levels of headings `<h1>`, `<h2>`, .... `<h6>`.
